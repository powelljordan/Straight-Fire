				content:"I purchased this basketball for outdoor use. I'm in my 30s and was looking for a basketball to use at the court at the park. I was impressed with the grip this ball has, even after use. As it gets dirty, it looses some of its grip, but if you'll just wipe it off with a damp cloth, it'll almost be like new. It also has good bounce, and holds air well.",

				content:"I have a regulation size BADEN black and white soccer ball- the classic! Bought this \"Wilson Traditional Black/White Soccer Ball, Size 3\" as a gift and it was delivered on time. The feel and texture is comfortable. I wanted to keep it for myself, but like I said, this was gift. Feels expensive to the touch when it is brand new, but the shiny gloss will eventually wear off with usage and time. Great for children, and even adults who want to play \"hack-sack\" with a bigger and firm soccer ball.",
